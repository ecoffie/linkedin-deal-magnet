Better benefits. A clear path to leadership.\n\nMy hands were shaking when I dialed.\n\nI owed everything to that company. They gave me my first break in government contracting when I had zero clearance and no past performance. They taught me FAR compliance, helped me get my security clearance, and trusted me with critical tasks.\n\nBut here's the thing: I'm 28. I have student loans. A growing family. Dreams that cost more than my current salary.\n\nThe conversation was harder than I expected.\n\nMy boss didn't try to match the offer. He couldn't. Instead, he said something that stopped me cold:\n\n'I'm not surprised. You've outgrown us. Go win big contracts. But remember: we built something together here. That doesn't disappear because you're leaving.'\n\nThat hit different.\n\nBecause in GovCon, it's not just about the money. It's about relationships. About integrity. About how you show up when you're leaving.\n\nI'm starting my new role next month. And I'm taking with me:\n- The relationships I built\n- The lessons I learned\n- The reputation I earned\n\nYour career is a journey. Sometimes you outgrow where you started. That's not disloyalty. That's growth.\n\nHave you ever left a company that shaped you? How did you handle it?\n\n#GovernmentContracting #CareerGrowth #GovCon #ProfessionalDevelopment"}]}

San Diego. Denver. Austin. D.C. And 7 more.\n\nAll while running my GovCon consulting firm.\n\nAnd it was my best financial year yet.\n\nHere's what I learned about remote work in government contracting:\n\n**Location independence is real**\nI closed $2.3M in contracts this year. Not a single in-person meeting. Every proposal submitted remotely. Every contract signed electronically. Every project managed through Teams.\n\n**Relationships happen everywhere**\nI met procurement officers at coffee shops. Had strategy calls from hotel lobbies. Closed deals while watching my daughter's soccer game from the sidelines.\n\n**Your office is wherever you make it**\nThat $500K DoD contract? Negotiated from an Airbnb in Asheville. The GSA schedule renewal? Handled from a coworking space in Nashville. My best ideas? Came during morning walks in new cities.\n\n**But here's the truth**\nRemote work in GovCon isn't about escaping. It's about freedom.\n\nFreedom to be present for family while building a business.\n\nFreedom to work when you're most productive—whether that's 6am or 10pm.\n\nFreedom to say yes to opportunities without being tied to one zip code.\n\nI'm not saying it's easy. Managing clearances remotely? Coordinating with primes across time zones? Building trust without handshakes?\n\nIt requires discipline. Systems. Clear communication.\n\nBut it's possible. And it's changing how contractors operate.\n\nIf you're building a GovCon business, don't let location limit you. The contracts are everywhere. The opportunities are digital. Your success isn't tied to an office.\n\nWhere are you building from? 🌎\n\n#RemoteWork #GovernmentContracting #GovCon #LocationIndependent #BusinessOwner"}]}

Your reputation is everything. And ghosting? It's unprofessional. It's disrespectful. And it's costing you relationships.\n\nI've seen it happen too many times:\n\n**Teaming situations**\nYou reach out to a prime contractor. They're interested. They ask for your capabilities statement. You spend hours preparing it. Send it over.\n\nThen... nothing.\n\nNo response. No 'thanks but no thanks.' No 'we'll keep you in mind.' Just silence.\n\n**Contract negotiations**\nYou're deep in negotiations for a subcontract. Terms are being discussed. Deadlines are being set. You're planning resources.\n\nThen the prime disappears.\n\nEmails go unanswered. Calls go to voicemail. The opportunity just... vanishes.\n\n**Hiring processes**\nYou interview a candidate. They're perfect. You tell them you'll have an answer by Friday.\n\nFriday comes and goes. They follow up. You ignore it.\n\nWhy?\n\nHere's what I've learned after 20 years in this industry:\n\n**Ghosting is a choice.**\n\nIt's not about being too busy. It's not about 'no news is good news.'\n\nIt's about not having the courage to have a difficult conversation.\n\nBut here's the thing:\n\nIn GovCon, relationships are currency. Your network is your net worth. And every time you ghost someone, you're devaluing both.\n\n**It takes 30 seconds to send a message:**\n\n'Thanks for your interest. We're going in a different direction, but I appreciate your time.'\n\n'We've decided to pursue another opportunity, but let's stay connected.'\n\n'I don't have an answer yet, but I'll follow up by [date].'\n\nThat's it. 30 seconds. One message. Basic respect.\n\nBecause in government contracting, the industry is smaller than you think.\n\nThat person you ghosted today? They might be evaluating your proposal tomorrow.\n\nThat prime you ignored? They might be your teammate on the next big contract.\n\nThat candidate you left hanging? They might work for your competitor next month.\n\n**Professionalism isn't optional.**\n\nIt's not about whether you're a large contractor or a small business.\n\nIt's not about whether you're the prime or the sub.\n\nIt's about being a professional. Showing respect. Honoring your commitments.\n\nYour reputation follows you. Your actions define you.\n\nSo do better.\n\nRespond to emails. Return calls. Send that 'no thanks' message.\n\nIt's not hard. It's just the right thing to do.\n\nWho's with me? 🙋‍♂️\n\n#GovernmentContracting #Professionalism #GovCon #Relationships #BusinessEtiquette"}]}

They leave. Now you're paying a recruiter $15K to find a replacement. Plus onboarding. Plus the learning curve. Plus the risk of losing the contract if you can't fill the role in time.\n\n**Proposal writers**\nYou won't give them a raise. They join a competitor. Now you're paying consultants $200/hour to write proposals. Or worse - you're losing bids because your proposals aren't as strong.\n\n**Program managers**\nYou won't invest in their growth. They take a better opportunity. Now you're scrambling to find someone who understands your contracts, your clients, your team. And you're paying premium rates to get them.\n\n**The math doesn't work.**\n\nA 10% raise costs you $10K on a $100K salary.\n\nReplacing that person? That costs you:\n- $15-30K in recruiting fees\n- $20-50K in lost productivity during transition\n- $10-25K in onboarding and training\n- Potential contract risk if key roles aren't filled\n\n**That's $45-105K to save $10K.**\n\nIt's not smart business. It's short-sighted.\n\n**Here's what great GovCon companies do differently:**\n\nThey pay market rates. They invest in their people. They recognize value before someone else does.\n\nThey understand that in government contracting, your people ARE your competitive advantage.\n\nYour clearance holders? They're your access to classified work.\n\nYour proposal writers? They're your path to new contracts.\n\nYour program managers? They're your relationship with agencies.\n\n**You can't replace that with a job posting.**\n\nSo here's my advice:\n\nIf someone asks for a raise, listen.\n\nIf they're valuable, pay them.\n\nIf you can't afford to keep them, you definitely can't afford to lose them.\n\nBecause in GovCon, talent isn't just an expense.\n\nIt's an investment.\n\nAnd the companies that understand that?\n\nThey're the ones winning the big contracts.\n\nThey're the ones retaining their best people.\n\nThey're the ones building something sustainable.\n\n**Pay your people what they're worth.

Market shifts. Revenue drops.\n\n**Their first move?**\n\n'We need to reduce headcount.'\n\n'Everyone takes a 10% pay cut.'\n\n'We're restructuring to align with market conditions.'\n\n**Translation:**\n\nEmployees pay the price. Executives protect themselves.\n\nThey lay off the people who built the company.\n\nThey cut salaries of those who delivered results.\n\nThey protect their own compensation while asking others to sacrifice.\n\n**Type 2: The Accountable Leader**\n\nContract gets cancelled. Market shifts. Revenue drops.\n\n**Their first move?**\n\n'I'm taking a 50% pay cut.'\n\n'We're cutting executive compensation before touching employee salaries.'\n\n'We'll find a way to keep our people.'\n\n**Translation:**\n\nLeadership leads from the front. Everyone shares the burden.\n\nThey protect their team. They sacrifice first. They find solutions.\n\n**The contrast is stark.**\n\n**I've watched this play out:**\n\n**Scenario 1: Major contract loss**\n\nTypical executive: 'We need to let go of 20% of our team. It's unfortunate, but necessary.'\n\n*Same executive keeps their full salary, bonus, and benefits.*\n\nAccountable leader: 'I'm reducing my compensation by 40%. My leadership team is taking 25% cuts. We're going to try everything to keep our people.'\n\n**Scenario 2: Market downturn**\n\nTypical executive: 'Everyone needs to share the burden. We're implementing across-the-board pay cuts.'\n\n*Executive pay 'cut' is 5%. Employee cuts are 15%.*\n\nAccountable leader: 'I'm taking the biggest cut. My team is next. We'll protect our people as long as possible.'\n\n**Scenario 3: Budget shortfall**\n\nTypical executive: 'We have to make tough decisions. Some roles are being eliminated.'\n\n*Roles eliminated are frontline employees. Executive roles remain untouched.*\n\nAccountable leader: 'We're eliminating executive positions first. Reducing management overhead. Doing everything we can to preserve jobs.'\n\n**Here's what I've learned after 20 years in government contracting:**\n\n**The best leaders lead from the front.**\n\nThey don't ask their team to sacrifice what they're not willing to sacrifice themselves.\n\nThey don't protect themselves while others lose their jobs.\n\nThey don't make 'tough decisions' that only affect other people.\n\n**Great leaders understand:**\n\n**If you're asking people to take pay cuts, you take the biggest one.**\n\n**If you're asking people to make sacrifices, you sacrifice first.**\n\n**If you're laying people off, you've already cut your own position from the budget.**\n\n**Because leadership isn't about protecting yourself.**\n\n**It's about protecting your people.**\n\n**It's about taking responsibility.**\n\n**It's about leading by example.**\n\n**In GovCon, contracts come and go.**\n\n**Markets shift. Budgets change. Opportunities fluctuate.**\n\n**But how you treat your people during tough times?**\n\n**That defines your leadership.**\n\n**That builds your reputation.**\n\n**That determines who wants to work for you when things get better.**\n\n**The typical executive?**\n\n**They lose their best people. They damage their reputation. They struggle to rebuild.**\n\n**The accountable leader?**\n\n**They keep their team. They strengthen their culture. They come back stronger.**\n\n**Because people remember how you treated them when times were tough.**\n\n**They remember who you protected.**\n\n**They remember who you asked to sacrifice.**\n\n**They remember who led from the front.**\n\n**Which type of leader are you?**\n\n#Leadership #Accountability #GovernmentContracting #GovCon #ExecutiveLeadership #Layoffs #PayCuts"}]}

Not a relationship.\n\nA business decision.\n\nAnd $30K more salary? That's significant.\n\nThat's $30K I can invest. Save. Use to build a better life.\n\n**2. Growth matters more than comfort.**\n\nSure, the first role was safe. Comfortable. Fine.\n\nBut the second role? It has a clear path to program management.\n\nThat's career-defining growth.\n\n**3. Timing matters.**\n\nThe better opportunity came when I needed it.\n\nNot next year. Not next month. Now.\n\nAnd opportunities like this don't come often.\n\n**4. I owe myself the best.**\n\nNot the company. Not the recruiter. Not anyone else.\n\nMyself.\n\nAnd the best decision for me is the one that advances my career the most.\n\n**Here's how I handled it:**\n\n**I called the first company.**\n\nDirectly. Personally. No ghosting.\n\n**I explained the situation.**\n\n'I received another offer that's a better fit for my career goals. I apologize for the inconvenience, but I need to withdraw my acceptance.'\n\n**I was professional.**\n\nRespectful. Honest. Direct.\n\n**I didn't make excuses.**\n\nI didn't blame them. I didn't lie.\n\nI just explained my decision.\n\n**And you know what?**\n\n**They understood.**\n\nThey weren't happy, but they understood.\n\nBecause they've been in my position before.\n\nThey've made tough career decisions.\n\nThey know how this works.\n\n**Here's what I've learned:**\n\n**In GovCon, opportunities come fast.**\n\nOne day you're waiting. The next day you have two offers.\n\nThat's just how it works.\n\n**And you have to make decisions quickly.**\n\nBecause good opportunities don't wait.\n\n**But here's what matters:**\n\n**Be professional.**\n\nDon't ghost. Don't be rude. Don't burn bridges.\n\nExplain your decision. Be respectful. Move on.\n\n**Trust your gut.**\n\nIf something feels like a better fit, it probably is.\n\nIf something offers more growth, it's probably worth it.\n\n**Prioritize your career.**\n\nBecause no one else will.\n\nNo company will prioritize your growth over their needs.\n\nNo recruiter will prioritize your salary over their commission.\n\nYou have to prioritize yourself.\n\n**And here's the reality:**\n\n**Companies back out of offers all the time.**\n\nThey rescind offers. They delay start dates. They change terms.\n\nThey do what's best for them.\n\n**So why shouldn't you?**\n\n**Why shouldn't you do what's best for you?**\n\n**Now, I'm not saying:**\n\n- Back out of every offer that gets a better one\n- Be unprofessional about it\n- Burn bridges unnecessarily\n\n**I'm saying:**\n\n- Make career decisions that serve you\n- Be professional when you do\n- Trust the process\n\n**Because here's what I believe:**\n\n**The best opportunities come when you're open to them.**\n\nWhen you're willing to say yes.\n\nWhen you're willing to make tough decisions.\n\nWhen you're willing to prioritize yourself.\n\n**And that's exactly what happened to me.**\n\nI was open. I said yes. I made the tough decision.\n\n**And now?**\n\n**I'm starting a role that pays $30K more.**\n\n**That has a clear growth path.**\n\n**That aligns with my career goals.**\n\n**And that I'm genuinely excited about.**\n\n**Was it awkward backing out?**\n\nYes.\n\n**Was it uncomfortable?**\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n**Was it the right decision?**\n\n**100%.**\n\n**Sometimes the best decisions are the hardest ones.**\n\n**Sometimes you have to choose yourself.**\n\n**Sometimes you have to trust the process.**\n\n**And sometimes?**\n\n**Sometimes you have to back out.**\n\n**Because your career is worth it.**\n\n**You're worth it.**\n\n**Have you ever backed out of a job offer?

Weekends. Between meetings.\n\nI helped small businesses navigate government contracting.\n\nI helped them win proposals.\n\nI helped them understand FAR/DFARS.\n\n**I made $2K the first month.**\n\n**Then $5K.**\n\n**Then $10K.**\n\n**Phase 2: Build content and audience (Years 2-4)**\n\nI started creating LinkedIn content.\n\nSharing GovCon insights.\n\nTeaching what I'd learned.\n\nBuilding an audience.\n\n**1,000 followers.**\n\n**Then 5,000.**\n\n**Then 10,000.**\n\n**Phase 3: Scale the business (Years 4-5)**\n\nMy consulting business grew.\n\nMore clients.
