## Comparison with Existing Knowledge Base

The agency JSON files in `/bootcamp/agencies/` already contain government pain points such as:

- **DoD**: IT acquisition delays, cybersecurity CMMC implementation, weapon systems delays, supply chain security, zero-trust architecture complexity, AI/ML integration challenges
- **VA**: EHR modernization delays, IT infrastructure modernization gaps, claims processing automation challenges, telehealth platform scalability, legacy system integration

These are different from the small business-focused pain points found in industry events. The industry events reveal **operational/process challenges** related to:
- Small business outreach and engagement
- Vendor discovery and evaluation
- Program management and coordination

While the agency JSON files reveal **strategic/technical challenges** related to:
- Major IT modernization programs
- Cybersecurity implementation
- Legacy system replacement
- Acquisition process improvements

Both types are valuable - the industry events show day-to-day operational pain points, while the JSON files show strategic priorities and major programs.

2. ✅ Cross-reference with agency JSON files in knowledge base (completed)
3. **Extract from APEX PDF** when available - may reveal more government challenges
4. **Review DoD webinar PDFs** for additional government pain points
5. **Continue searching** for industry day transcripts that discuss government challenges
6. **Integrate findings** into agency JSON files if appropriate (as operational/process pain points)
