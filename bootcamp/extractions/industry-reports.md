## Key Findings Summary

### Major Trend: Small Business Participation Decline
- **49% decline** in small businesses participating in federal contracting since FY 2008 (144,774 in 2008 → 73,833 in 2023)
- **Loss of over 90,000 small businesses** from the contracting industrial base
- **39% decrease** in small businesses fulfilling federal contracts between 2010-2020

### Contract Consolidation Impact
- Consolidated contracts increased dramatically: **10,483 in 2010 → 204,739 in 2023** (1,850% increase)
- Higher market concentration leads to less competitive procurement (more single-bid solicitations, non-competitive awards)
- Shift from fixed-price to cost-plus contracts in consolidated markets
- Exclusive contract vehicles favoring large corporations make it difficult for small businesses to compete

3. Use industry findings to validate and prioritize agency-specific pain points
4. Consider adding to agencies with high small business goals (SBA, GSA, DoD OSDBU programs)
