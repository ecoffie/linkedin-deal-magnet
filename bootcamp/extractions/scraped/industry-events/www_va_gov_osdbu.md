## Regulatory Information

#### Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act

This memorandum communicates the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) policy on non-retaliation and small entities’ rights under SBREFA, including the right to file a comment with the Small Business Administration's (SBA’s) Office of the National Ombudsman (ONO). VA prohibits retaliatory actions by VA employees against any small business regarding SBA’s ONO assistance, or questions or complaints about VA regulatory enforcement actions, requirements or policies.
