OSDBU is responsible for providing access to small businesses by connecting them with their prospective Small Business Liaison (SBL) based on the geographical location of their business and community of interest. Each VA Administration, Staff Office, and VISN is represented by an SBL. For a directory of SBLs by VA office, visit the [Small Business Liaisons page](https://vetbiz.va.gov/technicalassistance/~/resources/services-sbl/).

[Connect SDVOSB and VOSB to Appropriate PDMs and SBLs](https://vetbiz.va.gov/technicalassistance/#kbarticle-item-3)

Through the National Veterans Small Business Engagement and the Direct Access Program, OSDBU directly connects SDVOSB, VOSB, and other small businesses with Procurement Decision Makers from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), other Federal agencies and commercial partners, with small business needs to help them to successfully compete for procurement contracts.

[Capabilities Statement Review](https://vetbiz.va.gov/technicalassistance/#kbarticle-item-4)

Small Business owners often ask about how to best present themselves to VA officials, particularly contracting officers, small business specialists, and prime contractors. OSDBU consistently advises that there are three key ingredients to making a favorable impression within the government marketplace:

- Know your potential customer.
- Be prepared to deliver a concise “elevator speech” (a 30-second description of your expertise).
- Have a solid “Capabilities Statement” that addresses key elements such as past performance, core competencies, and business information.
