# Extraction Working Files

This directory is for your active extraction work. Use it to store:

- Extraction templates filled out for specific agencies
- Notes and research
- Source documents (if downloading PDFs)
- Work-in-progress JSON files (before moving to `agencies/`)

## How to Use

1. Copy `EXTRACTION_TEMPLATE.md` from parent directory
2. Rename to `[agency-name]-extraction.md`
3. Fill it out as you research
4. Once complete, create the JSON file in `agencies/` folder
5. Archive or delete the extraction file (or keep as reference)

## Example Files

- `epa-extraction.md` - EPA extraction work
- `interior-extraction.md` - Interior extraction work
- etc.
