## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Create detection rules** for all 20 agencies in `component-agency-rules.json`
2. **Research pain points** from FY2025 budget justification books
3. **Add pain points** to `agency-pain-points.json` (8 per agency = 160 new pain points)
4. **Update frontend extraction** in `content-engine-test.html`
5. **Update validation script** with test cases
6. **Test with real contracts** from each agency

### Research Sources Needed:
- FY2025 Budget Justification Books (O&M, Procurement, RDT&E) for each agency
- Congressional testimony from agency leaders
- GAO reports on agency challenges
- OIG Top Management Challenges reports
