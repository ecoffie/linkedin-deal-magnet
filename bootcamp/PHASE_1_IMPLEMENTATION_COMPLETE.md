## 💡 Key Lessons Learned

### Detection Patterns:
- Full agency names work best for pattern matching
- Abbreviations (DLA, MDA, DISA) are essential for short office names
- Keywords provide backup detection when patterns fail
- Location-based detection adds confidence

### Pain Point Quality:
- Specific budget numbers add credibility ($46.9B, 55+ AI models)
- FY2025 context shows current priorities (budget cuts, reorganizations)
- Technical details differentiate from generic pain points (HBTSS, GPI, MAI)
- Quantifiable metrics make pain points actionable (300K contracts, $599B audited)

### Validation:
- 100% detection rate achievable with proper pattern coverage
- Automated testing catches missing mappings immediately
- Parent agency fallback prevents breaking existing functionality
