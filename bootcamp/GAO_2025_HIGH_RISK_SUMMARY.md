## Recommendations for Knowledge Base Updates

### 1. Update All Agencies with IT Management Pain Points

Add to all agency JSON files:

```json
{
  "point": "IT acquisition and management challenges including project delays, budget overruns, and need for improved oversight and mature acquisition practices",
  "source": "GAO High-Risk List 2025 - Improving IT Acquisitions and Management",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

### 2. Add Disaster Assistance to DHS/FEMA

Add to DHS knowledge base:

```json
{
  "point": "Federal disaster assistance delivery challenges due to increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, straining federal resources and requiring more efficient relief efforts",
  "source": "GAO High-Risk List 2025 - Improving the Delivery of Federal Disaster Assistance",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

### 3. Verify Existing GAO References

- ✅ VA IT Management - Already included
- ✅ DoD IT Management - Already included
- ✅ DHS Critical Infrastructure - Already included
- ✅ DOE Environmental Cleanup - Already included
- ✅ DOI Federal Real Property - Already included

### 4. Cross-Reference with Agency Forecasts

- Compare GAO findings with agency procurement forecasts
- Identify alignment between high-risk areas and procurement priorities
- Use to validate pain point priorities
