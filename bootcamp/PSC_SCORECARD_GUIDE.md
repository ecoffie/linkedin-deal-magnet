# PSC Federal Business Forecast Scorecard Guide

The Professional Services Council (PSC) annually evaluates procurement forecasts from **70+ federal agencies**, making it one of the most comprehensive sources for identifying agency-specific procurement challenges and pain points.

## What is the PSC Scorecard?

The PSC Federal Business Forecast Scorecard assesses agency procurement forecasts based on **15 key attributes**:

1. Clarity of project descriptions
2. Availability of contact information
3. Specificity of anticipated solicitation dates
4. User-friendly format (web-based vs. PDF)
5. Comprehensiveness of information
6. Regular updates
7. Searchability
8. NAICS code inclusion
9. Contract value ranges
10. Set-aside information
11. Geographic location
12. Performance period
13. Place of performance
14. And more...

## How to Use for Knowledge Base Updates

### Step 1: Access the Scorecard

Visit: https://www.pscouncil.org/scorecard

### Step 2: Identify Agencies to Prioritize

**Focus on agencies rated as:**
- **"Good"** - Well-maintained forecasts indicate active procurement planning (likely to have clear pain points)
- **"Needs Improvement"** - Poor forecasts may indicate underlying procurement challenges (pain points in forecasting/planning itself)

**Also check:**
- Agencies that improved year-over-year (shows active attention to procurement)
- Agencies that declined (may indicate resource constraints or shifting priorities)

### Step 3: Extract Pain Points

From the PSC Scorecard, you can infer pain points:

**Direct Pain Points:**
- Agencies with poor forecasts often struggle with:
  - Procurement planning and transparency
  - Resource allocation for acquisition functions
  - Small business outreach and communication
  - Forecasting accuracy and timeliness

**Indirect Pain Points:**
- Agencies with "Good" ratings but specific gaps (e.g., "lacks NAICS codes") may indicate:
  - Need for better vendor categorization
  - Challenges in requirement definition
  - IT/system limitations

### Step 4: Cross-Reference with Agency Forecasts

For each agency in the scorecard:
1. Visit their actual forecast (PSC provides links)
2. Read project descriptions for implicit pain points
3. Note gaps mentioned in PSC evaluation
4. Combine with GAO reports and strategic plans

## Integration with Knowledge Base

### For Each Agency:

1. **Check PSC Scorecard Rating**
   - If "Good": Focus on pain points revealed in their detailed forecasts
   - If "Fair" or "Needs Improvement": Note forecasting/planning pain points

2. **Review PSC Evaluation Details**
   - What specific attributes are missing or weak?
   - What does this reveal about agency procurement capabilities?

3. **Cross-Reference with Actual Forecast**
   - Use PSC-provided links to agency forecasts
   - Extract pain points from project descriptions
   - Note any themes across multiple projects

4. **Combine with Other Sources**
   - GAO reports for that agency
   - OIG findings
   - Strategic plans

### Example Pain Point Extraction:

From PSC Scorecard: "Agency X forecast lacks NAICS codes and contact information"

**Extracted Pain Points:**
- "Procurement forecast transparency and vendor communication challenges"
- "Limited small business outreach capabilities"
- "IT system limitations affecting forecast quality"

## Annual Update Process

1. **Check PSC Scorecard Release** (typically Q2-Q3 each year)
2. **Review Agency Ratings Changes**
3. **Identify New Agencies Added**
4. **Extract Pain Points from Evaluations**
5. **Update Knowledge Base Files**
6. **Cross-Reference with Updated Forecasts**

## Additional Resources

- **PSC Member Resources**: Additional analysis available to PSC members
- **PSC Events**: Attend PSC conferences for deeper insights
- **PSC Publications**: Related reports on procurement trends

## Notes

- Use as secondary source to identify agencies for deeper research
- Combine with primary sources (GAO, agency forecasts) for authoritative pain points
- Focus on actionable insights for contractors, not just ratings
