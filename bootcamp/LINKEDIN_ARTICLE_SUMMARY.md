**The FY2026 NDAA Just Changed Everything for Government Contractors**

I've analyzed the full FY2026 NDAA and found 8 critical provisions that will impact how you do business with the federal government.

**The Big 3 (Most Urgent):**

1. **AI/ML Security Policy (180-Day Deadline)** - DoD must implement department-wide AI security policy. Agencies need help NOW with:
   - AI security consulting
   - Testing and validation tools
   - Governance frameworks
   - Workforce training

2. **BIOSECURE Act** - Prohibits biotech equipment from adversary countries. Creates opportunities for:
   - Replacement contracts
   - Supplier vetting services
   - Compliance consulting

3. **Procurement Security Framework (CMMC)** - Mandates NIST/CMMC alignment. Massive demand for:
   - CMMC assessment services
   - Cybersecurity compliance consulting
   - Security monitoring tools

**The Growth Areas:**

4. **SkyFoundry Program** - UAS industrial base expansion. Hot market for drone manufacturers and suppliers.

5. **Energy Resilience (ERCIP)** - Microgrids and smart water grids. Growing installation market.

6. **Progressive Design-Build** - New construction method for complex projects. Opens new opportunities.

**The Process Changes:**

7. **Outbound Investment Controls** - Expanded restrictions. Compliance consulting needed.

8. **CAS Threshold Changes** - $2M to $35M. Reduces compliance burden for smaller contracts.

**What This Means for You:**

Agencies are actively seeking contractors who can help them implement these changes. The 180-day AI security deadline creates immediate urgency.

**Top Agencies to Target:**
- DISA (AI/ML security)
- NIH, CDC, FDA (BIOSECURE compliance)
- USACE, NAVFAC (Design-build, energy)
- All DoD (UAS, CMMC, AI security)

**Action Items:**
