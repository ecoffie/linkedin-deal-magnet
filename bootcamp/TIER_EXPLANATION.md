# Tier System Explanation

The tier system categorizes agencies by priority for knowledge base expansion based on procurement volume, contract frequency, and market opportunity.

## Tier Definitions

### Tier 1: High-Priority Agencies

**Characteristics:**
- **Large budgets** ($10B+ total or significant procurement budgets)
- **Frequent contract awards** (hundreds to thousands annually)
- **Diverse procurement** (multiple NAICS codes, various contract types)
- **Strong small business programs** (clear set-aside preferences)
- **Broad contractor base** (accessible to many businesses)

**Why Tier 1?**
- Highest ROI for knowledge base work (affects most contractors)
- More forecast data available (easier to extract pain points)
- Better documented in GAO reports and strategic plans
- Most contractor inquiries likely focus on these agencies

**Examples:**
- HHS - $1.7T budget, massive healthcare IT procurement
- Treasury - $500B+ budget, financial systems modernization
- Interior - $18B+ budget, infrastructure and climate work
- Agriculture - $200B+ budget, food safety, rural programs

### Tier 2: Medium-Priority Agencies

**Characteristics:**
- **Moderate budgets** ($1B-$10B typically)
- **Specialized markets** (focused on specific industries/services)
- **Regular contracts** (dozens to hundreds annually)
- **Sub-agencies** (components of larger departments)
- **Niche opportunities** (specific expertise required)

**Why Tier 2?**
- Still significant opportunities but more specialized
- May require domain expertise to extract relevant pain points
- Important for contractors in specific industries
- Good balance of effort vs. value

**Examples:**
- Department of Agriculture sub-agencies (USDA FS, NRCS)
- DOI sub-agencies (NPS, BLM, USGS)
- HHS sub-agencies (CMS, CDC, FDA)
- Transportation sub-agencies (FAA, FHWA)
- Commerce sub-agencies (NOAA, NIST)

### Tier 3: Specialized/Smaller Agencies

**Characteristics:**
- **Smaller budgets** (<$1B typically, though some exceptions)
- **Highly specialized** (very specific missions)
- **Infrequent contracts** (dozens or fewer annually)
- **Niche markets** (very specific contractor requirements)
- **Limited data** (may have less forecast/GMO documentation)

**Why Tier 3?**
- Lower overall impact but important for niche contractors
- May require more research effort per pain point
- Important for completeness (70+ agency goal)
- Some may have unique high-value opportunities despite size

**Examples:**
- National Archives
- Office of Personnel Management
- Peace Corps
- GSA sub-components
- Smaller independent agencies

## Priority Criteria Summary

| Factor | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Budget Size** | $10B+ | $1B-$10B | <$1B |
| **Contract Frequency** | Hundreds/thousands | Dozens/hundreds | Dozens or fewer |
| **Market Breadth** | Broad, diverse | Specialized | Highly specialized |
| **Data Availability** | Extensive | Moderate | Limited |
| **Contractor Base** | Large, diverse | Medium, specialized | Small, niche |
| **Extraction Effort** | Moderate | Moderate-High | High |
| **Value/ROI** | Highest | Medium | Lower but important |

## Expansion Strategy by Tier

### Phase 1: Tier 1 Agencies (Priority)

**Goal:** Complete all Tier 1 agencies first

**Rationale:**
- Highest impact on most contractors
- Best data availability (easier extraction)
- Strongest ROI for time investment
- Most likely to be requested by users

**Status:** 
- Already completed: HHS, Treasury, EPA ✅
- Remaining: Interior, Agriculture, Transportation, Education, State, Commerce, Labor, HUD, SBA, FEMA, NIH, NSF, SSA, DOJ, USAID

### Phase 2: Tier 2 Agencies (Secondary)

**Goal:** Add Tier 2 agencies after Tier 1 complete

**Rationale:**
- Important for specialized contractors
- Still significant opportunities
- May require more research but valuable
- Completes major department coverage

### Phase 3: Tier 3 Agencies (Final)

**Goal:** Complete coverage for all 70+ agencies

**Rationale:**
- Comprehensive coverage goal
- Important for niche contractors
- Completes knowledge base
- May uncover unique opportunities

## How to Use Tiers for Extraction

### When Choosing Which Agency to Extract Next:

1. **Start with Tier 1** - Highest priority
2. **Focus on incomplete Tier 1** - Check what's already done
3. **Consider your expertise** - Tier 2/3 might be easier if you know the domain
4. **Balance effort** - Some Tier 2 might be quick if data is good

### Extraction Difficulty by Tier:

**Tier 1:** ⭐⭐ (Easier)
- More forecast data
- More GAO reports
- Better documentation
- Clearer pain points

**Tier 2:** ⭐⭐⭐ (Moderate)
- Moderate data availability
- May need to research sub-agencies separately
- More specialized knowledge helpful
- Still good documentation

**Tier 3:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Harder)
- Limited forecast data
- Fewer GAO reports
- May need more primary research
- Specialized expertise very helpful

## Current Tier Status

### Tier 1 Complete ✅
- DoD (Department of Defense)
- DHS (Department of Homeland Security)
- VA (Department of Veterans Affairs)
- GSA (General Services Administration)
- Navy (Department of the Navy)
- HHS (Department of Health and Human Services)
- Treasury (Department of the Treasury)
- EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)

### Tier 1 Remaining ⏳

- Agriculture
- Transportation
- Education
- State
- Commerce
- Labor
- Housing and Urban Development
- SBA
- FEMA
- NIH
- NSF
- SSA

### Tier 2 & 3
- Not yet started (will begin after Tier 1 complete)

## Recommendations

**For Quick Wins:**
- Focus on remaining Tier 1 agencies
- Start with agencies you have domain knowledge in
- Use GSA Gateway for easy forecast access

**For Maximum Impact:**
- Complete all Tier 1 first
- These affect the most contractors
- Best ROI on extraction time

**For Specialization:**
- If you work in a specific industry, Tier 2 sub-agencies might be more valuable
- Still follow Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3 order overall
